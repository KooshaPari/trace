Protect external and internal consumers:

- Inspect deltas in `api/routers/`, `clients/`, `server/contracts/`, and `work-prompts/api.md`.
- Cross-check OpenAPI specs (`docs/openapi/`), MCP protocol expectations, and SDK bindings.
- Evaluate rollout impact on `integrations/` partners and `fastmcp.json` registrations.
- Recommend contract tests, version bumps, or deprecation notices.
