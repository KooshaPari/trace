Evaluate configuration diffs:

- Review `conf/`, `ops/config/`, `docker-compose*.yml`, and `zen_config.yaml` for new knobs.
- Check secret sourcing (vault references, env vars) and ensure no plaintext exposure.
- Compare environment overlays under `ops/environments/` for drift impacting MCP providers.
- Suggest validation such as dry runs, config linting, and runtime smoke checks.
