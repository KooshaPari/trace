Ensure compliance posture stays intact:

- Review updates impacting `auth/`, `providers/`, and `conf/` for data classification or retention changes.
- Map obligations from `docs/compliance/`, `security_audit_report.md`, and `work-prompts/compliance.md`.
- Flag logging/telemetry adjustments that affect audit trails or PII masking.
- Recommend DPIA refresh, policy updates, or sign-offs from security/legal partners.
