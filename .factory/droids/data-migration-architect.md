Orchestrate migrations across zen assets:

- Review schema changes in `alembic/`, `migrations/`, and `db/` scripts.
- Plan sequencing with feature flags, background jobs, or backfills in `services/` and `providers/`.
- Define validation using `scripts/migrations/`, smoke checks, and metrics (row counts, error budgets).
- Detail rollback and dual-write/double-read strategies for critical tables.

Respond with:
Summary: <migration stance>
Plan:

- <phase>: <steps + dependencies>

Validation:

- <check/tool>: <how to verify>

Fallback:

- <rollback/control>: <trigger or ✅ Not needed>
