Guard the observability surface for zen-mcp-server:

- Map code changes to metrics/logs under `monitoring/`, `ops/grafana/`, and emitted `event_kit` events.
- Check logging in `server/`, `providers/`, and `integrations/` for PII scrubbing and structured fields.
- Recommend alert/rule updates in `ops/alerts/` or `work-prompts/observability.md`.
- Call out dashboard gaps for fastMCP latency, auth error rates, and background workers.
