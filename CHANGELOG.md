### Added - 2026-01-31
- **End-to-end plan (Phases 0–4)**
  - Phase 0: First-run checklist (`docs/checklists/FIRST_RUN_CHECKLIST.md`), Python migrations in README, optional health preflight for Python tables (503 when migrations missing).
  - Phase 1: Python migrations in CI and deployment runbook; frontend API routing for test-cases and links (Python backend); error toasts for failed test cases and links loads.
  - Phase 2: Domain-optimized Feature view (epic/feature hierarchy, real data, Add Epic/Add Feature); domain-optimized API view (project API items + reference); PROJECT_VIEWS_ARCHITECTURE updated.
  - Phase 3: Standardized list loading skeleton (`ListLoadingSkeleton`); view-specific empty states with primary CTA in ItemsTableView; view-specific titles (Features, API Endpoints, etc.) replacing "Item Registry"; 401/403 handling (redirect to login, 403 toast).
  - Phase 4: Deployment runbook extended with deployment order, migration order, and health endpoints; health endpoints documented for gateway, Go, and Python; CI already runs Python migrations (Phase 1).
