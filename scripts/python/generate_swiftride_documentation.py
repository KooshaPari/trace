# ============================================================================

TECHNICAL_SPECS = [
    {
        "title": "Matching Algorithm Specification",
        "category": "algorithm",
        "description": "Detailed specification of the rider-driver matching algorithm including spatial indexing, scoring, and optimization strategies.",
        "content": """
## Overview
The matching algorithm pairs riders with optimal drivers using multi-factor scoring.

## Matching Criteria
1. **Distance**: Drivers within 5km radius, scored inversely by distance
2. **ETA**: Estimated time to pickup, must be <10 minutes
3. **Driver Score**: Rating (0-5) + acceptance rate (0-100%) + completion rate (0-100%)
4. **Vehicle Match**: Rider preferences (capacity, accessibility, vehicle type)
5. **Surge Priority**: Higher fare rides prioritized during surge

## Algorithm Steps
1. Query Redis GEORADIUS for drivers within 5km
2. Filter by availability, vehicle match, minimum rating (4.5+)
3. Calculate composite score: score = (1/distance) * 0.4 + driver_rating * 0.3 + acceptance_rate * 0.3
4. Sort by score descending, offer to top 3 drivers in sequence
5. Fallback: expand radius to 10km if no match in 30 seconds

## Performance Requirements
- p50 latency: <50ms
- p99 latency: <150ms
- Throughput: 10,000 matches/second

        "description": "End-to-end payment processing including authorization, capture, refunds, and dispute handling.",
        "content": """
## Payment Lifecycle

### 1. Pre-Authorization (Ride Request)
- Validate payment method with $1 hold
- Check fraud score via Stripe Radar
- Reserve estimated fare amount
- Store authorization token

### 2. Ride Completion
- Calculate final fare (base + distance + time + surge + tolls)
- Capture authorized amount (or authorized + 20% if higher)
- Release unused hold within 5 minutes
- Issue receipt via email/SMS

### 3. Driver Payout
- Calculate driver earnings (fare - platform fee - payment processing)
- Aggregate to weekly payout batch
- Transfer via Stripe Connect (ACH/instant)
- Handle failed transfers with retry (3 attempts)

### 4. Refunds & Disputes
- Partial/full refund within 30 days
- Chargeback handling via Stripe
- Dispute resolution workflow with evidence submission

## Error Handling
- Payment declined: retry with backup payment method
- Capture failure: manual review queue
- Payout failure: email driver, retry next cycle

        "content": """
## Location Update Protocol

### Driver Location
- Update frequency: Every 5 seconds while active
- Accuracy requirement: ±10 meters
- Battery optimization: Reduce to 15s when idle
- Storage: Redis (real-time) + PostgreSQL (historical)
- TTL: 60 seconds in Redis

### Rider Location
- Update frequency: On-demand during booking, every 10s during active ride
- Accuracy requirement: ±50 meters
- Privacy: Location not stored after ride completion

### Geofencing
- Service area boundaries defined in PostGIS
- Surge zones updated every 60 seconds
- Airport/event special zones

## Technical Implementation
- Client: iOS CoreLocation, Android FusedLocationProvider
- Transport: WebSocket for real-time, HTTP fallback
- Compression: Protocol Buffers for bandwidth efficiency
- Privacy: Encrypt location data at rest and in transit
