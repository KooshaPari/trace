**Agent-native, multi-view requirements traceability and project management system.**

TracerTM is a comprehensive requirements traceability matrix (RTM) system designed for modern software development workflows. It provides a "Defense in Depth" approach to project governance, linking requirements to code, tests, and deployments across multiple architectural lenses.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Multi-View Traceability**: View projects through code, API, database, deployment, and documentation lenses.
- 🤖 **Agent-Native Design**: Built-in support for AI-assisted analysis and automated traceability maintenance.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Sync**: WebSocket-based live updates across all management interfaces.
- 📊 **Graph Visualization**: Interactive dependency graphs and impact analysis powered by Neo4j.
- 🛡 **Hardened Governance**: SLSA provenance, signed attestations, and automated quality gates.
- 📈 **Full Observability**: Integrated metrics (Prometheus), logs (Loki), and tracing (Jaeger).

---

## 🏗 Architecture

TracerTM uses a high-performance, polyglot architecture:

- **Backend (Go)**: High-performance API server managing core business logic and integrations.
- **Python Services**: Specialized services for data analysis, CLI/TUI tools, and background processing.
- **Frontend (React/TS)**: Modern SPA with TanStack Router, Zustand, and interactive visualizations.
- **Persistence**: PostgreSQL (Relational), Neo4j (Graph), Redis (Cache), and NATS (Messaging).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+, Python 3.11+, Node.js/Bun
- PostgreSQL 17+, Redis 7+, Neo4j 5.0+, NATS 2.9+
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) (Task runner) and [Process Compose](https://github.com/F_S_A/process-compose)

### Quick Start (Native Environment)

```bash
# 1. Install all dependencies
task install

# 2. Run database migrations
task db:migrate

# 3. Start all services with interactive TUI dashboard
task dev:tui

# 4. Access the Unified Gateway
# http://localhost:4000 (Frontend, API, and Docs)
```

---

## 📊 Observability & APM

TracerTM includes enterprise-grade monitoring out of the box:
- **Metrics**: http://localhost:3000 (Grafana) / http://localhost:9090 (Prometheus)
- **Tracing**: http://localhost:16686 (Jaeger UI) - Track requests across Go and Python.
- **Logs**: Centralized log aggregation via Loki and Promtail.

---

## 🛡 Governance & Hardening

TracerTM operates at a **critical** quality tier:
1. **Automated Quality Gates**: Ruff, Go build/vet, golangci-lint, TSC, and Tach boundaries.
2. **Provenance**: All builds generate SLSA attestations with digital signatures.
3. **Verification Policy**: Defined dispute workflows for quality gate decisions in `VERIFICATION_POLICY.md`.
4. **Security Scanning**: Automated `govulncheck`, `bandit`, and security audits.

### Review-Traceability Rule

- PR review comments that block requirements, API contracts, or architecture are treated as traceability events.
- For each closed PR in a stacked flow, record at least one of:
  - resolved comment thread, or
  - explicit follow-up PR reference with dependency order and trace matrix impact.
- PRD references and trace entries should include review-thread outcomes before promoting to `beta/rc`.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

We maintain a rigorous multi-layer testing strategy:
- **Unit & Integration**: `go test ./...` and `pytest tests/`
- **Frontend**: `bun test` and E2E via Playwright.
- **Complexity Audit**: Automated tracking of code complexity (Radon) and naming conventions.
- **Path Protection**: Architectural boundary enforcement via `tach`.
