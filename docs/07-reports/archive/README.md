# Archived Status and Summary Reports

**Archive Date**: 2025-11-30
**Reason**: Consolidation - Replaced by authoritative [docs/STATUS.md](/docs/STATUS.md)

This directory contains historical status reports, phase summaries, and implementation completion documents that were previously scattered in the root directory. These files have been archived to reduce clutter and prevent documentation contradictions.

---

## Important

**DO NOT USE THESE FILES FOR CURRENT PROJECT STATUS**

For current, authoritative project status, see:
- [docs/STATUS.md](/docs/STATUS.md) - Single source of truth for project status
- [START_HERE.md](/START_HERE.md) - Current project orientation
- [README.md](/README.md) - Current project overview

---

## Archive Contents

This archive contains **109 files** including:

### Phase Reports
- Phase 1-6 completion summaries
- Phase-specific deliverables and progress reports
- Detailed phase implementation documentation

### Status Reports
- Historical implementation status snapshots
- Progress dashboards
- Completion status documents

### Summary Reports
- Component implementation summaries (NATS, Redis, Neo4j, Supabase, etc.)
- Feature completion summaries (embeddings, search, auth, etc.)
- Migration summaries (GORM to SQLC, Atlas, etc.)
- Infrastructure setup summaries

### Research Summaries
- Executive summaries of research phases
- Technology decision summaries (SQLC, Upstash, tooling, etc.)
- Complete research synthesis documents

## Why These Were Archived

1. **Redundancy**: Multiple files contained overlapping or conflicting information
2. **Clutter**: 212 root-level markdown files made navigation difficult
3. **Inconsistency**: Tech stack claims varied between documents (Python vs Go backend)
4. **Consolidation**: All current status is now in `docs/STATUS.md`

---

## Using Archived Files

These files remain valuable for:
- **Historical Reference**: Understanding project evolution
- **Decision Context**: Why certain technologies were chosen
- **Lessons Learned**: What worked and what didn't
- **Audit Trail**: Complete implementation history

However, they should NOT be used for:
- Current project status
- Setup instructions
- Architecture documentation
- API references

For all current information, use the docs/ directory structure:
- `docs/00-overview/` - Project overview
- `docs/01-getting-started/` - Setup guides
- `docs/02-architecture/` - Architecture documentation
- `docs/03-planning/` - Current planning documents
- `docs/04-guides/` - How-to guides
- `docs/05-research/` - Research documentation
- `docs/06-api-reference/` - API documentation
- `docs/07-reports/` - Current reports
- `docs/08-reference/` - Reference documentation
- `docs/STATUS.md` - **Authoritative project status**

## Archive Organization

Files are organized by type (indicated by filename):

- `*PHASE*.md` - Phase-specific reports
- `*STATUS*.md` - Status snapshots
- `*SUMMARY*.md` - Implementation summaries
- `*COMPLETE*.md` - Completion reports
- `*IMPLEMENTATION*.md` - Implementation details
