## Data Flow

### Hooks (From useSpecifications)

- `useADRs(projectId)` - Fetch all ADRs

### State Management

- Local component state for modals and editing
- React Query for server state

## Styling Patterns Applied

### Color Scheme

- **Blue**: ADRs and information
- **Green**: Contracts and success states
- **Purple**: Features and testing
- **Red/Yellow/Orange**: Error and warning states
- **Gray**: Deprecated/archived states

### Layout

- Max width 1600px centered
- Responsive grids (md: 2 cols, lg: 3 cols)
- Consistent spacing (p-6, gap-4)
- Rounded cards (rounded-xl, rounded-2xl)

### Interactive Elements

- Hover effects on cards
- Loading skeletons
- Empty states with icons
- Toast notifications
- Modal dialogs with backdrop blur

## API Requirements

### Expected Endpoints

```
GET    /api/projects/{projectId}/adrs
POST   /api/adrs
PATCH  /api/adrs/{adrId}
DELETE /api/adrs/{adrId}

GET    /api/projects/{projectId}/contracts
POST   /api/contracts

GET    /api/projects/{projectId}/features
POST   /api/features
PATCH  /api/features/{featureId}

GET    /api/features/{featureId}/scenarios
POST   /api/scenarios
DELETE /api/scenarios/{scenarioId}
```

## Type Definitions Needed

From `@tracertm/types`:

- ADR, ADRStatus
- Contract, ContractStatus
- Feature, FeatureStatus
- Scenario, ScenarioStatus
- SpecificationSummary
- Condition, State, VerificationResult

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each view is self-contained with its own state management
2. **Consistent Patterns**: All views follow the same structure for filtering, searching, and creating
3. **Reusable Components**: Leverage existing specification components
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with grid layouts
5. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
6. **Performance**: Memoization, lazy loading, virtual scrolling ready
7. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with empty states and loading indicators

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Accessibility Features

- ✅ Semantic HTML
- ✅ ARIA labels for interactive elements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Color not only indicator
- ✅ Focus visible styles
- ✅ Loading states announced
- ✅ Toast notifications for feedback

## Performance Characteristics

- Initial load: Skeleton loading
- Data filtering: useMemo optimization
- Sorting: In-memory (client-side)
- Search: Real-time with debounce ready
- Modal: Portal-based (no layout thrashing)
- Pagination: Ready for implementation

## Estimated Development Time for Integration

- Type definitions: 1-2 hours
- API hooks: 2-3 hours
- Routing setup: 1 hour
- Testing: 4-6 hours
- Polish & optimization: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 10-15 hours
