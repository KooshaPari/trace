## Test Data

### Valid Credentials

```
Email: test@example.com
Password: password123
```

### Invalid Credentials

```
Email: invalid@example.com
Password: wrongpassword
```

### Test Routes

- Login: `/auth/login`
- Dashboard: `/`
- Protected: `/items`, `/projects`, `/settings`

---

## Test Patterns Used

### 1. Given-When-Then

All tests use the Given-When-Then structure for clarity:

```typescript
// Given: Initial state
// When: Action performed
// Then: Assert result
```

### 2. Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)

Tests follow the AAA pattern:

- **Arrange:** Setup test data and initial state
- **Act:** Perform the action being tested
- **Assert:** Verify the expected outcome

### 3. Single Responsibility

Each test focuses on one specific behavior.

### 4. Deterministic

Tests produce consistent results and are not flaky.

### 5. Independent

Tests can run in any order and don't depend on each other.

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- **Daily:** Monitor test results in CI
- **Weekly:** Review test execution logs
- **Monthly:** Update test data and selectors
- **Quarterly:** Refactor and optimize tests

### When to Update Tests

- When UI selectors change
- When API endpoints change
- When auth flow changes
- When new features are added
- When errors are found

### How to Extend Tests

1. Add new test to appropriate suite
2. Use existing patterns and helpers
3. Follow naming conventions
4. Update documentation
5. Verify tests pass locally before pushing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Won't Start

**Check:**

1. Dev server running on localhost:5173
2. Dependencies installed: `bun install`
3. No syntax errors: `bun run build`

**Fix:**

```bash
# Kill any existing dev server
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules .next
bun install

# Start fresh
bun run dev
```

### Tests Timeout

**Check:**

1. Page loads correctly in browser
2. Selectors match current UI
3. Network requests succeed

**Fix:**

```bash
# Increase timeout
# In test: await page.waitForURL("/", { timeout: 10000 });

# Or debug what's happening
bun run test:e2e auth-flow.spec.ts --debug
```

### Auth Token Not Found

**Check:**

1. API mocks configured in global-setup.ts
2. Mock returns token in response
3. localStorage not cleared unexpectedly

**Fix:**

```bash
# Verify mocks are loaded
grep -n "setupApiMocks" e2e/global-setup.ts

# Check mock responses
cat e2e/fixtures/api-mocks.ts
```

### Protected Routes Accessible Without Auth

**Check:**

1. Route guards implemented in app
2. Auth token checked before render
3. Redirect to login configured

**Fix:**

```bash
# Add route protection middleware
# In src/routes/__root.tsx:

const isAuthenticated = !!localStorage.getItem("authToken");
if (!isAuthenticated && isProtectedRoute) {
  return redirect("/auth/login");
}
```

- Login suite: 1-2 minutes
- Session suite: 1-2 minutes
- Logout suite: 1-2 minutes
- Token suite: 1-2 minutes
- Security suite: 1-2 minutes
- Error handling: 1-2 minutes
- Protected routes: 30-60 seconds
