## Technical Architecture Improvements

### Before: Fragmented Multi-Service Architecture

```
Developer manages manually:
├── PostgreSQL (port 5432)
├── Redis (port 6379)
├── Neo4j (port 7687)
├── NATS (port 4222)
├── Temporal (port 7233)
├── Go backend (port 8080)
├── Python backend (port 8000)
├── Frontend dev server (port 5173)
└── 8 separate terminal windows
    Manual restarts, port conflicts, inconsistent state
```

**Pain Points:**
- Manual service orchestration
- Port conflict resolution
- Inconsistent environment state
- Complex debugging across services
- No unified logging
- Manual hot reload configuration
- Service dependency management

### After: Unified Orchestrated Infrastructure

```
Single command: rtm dev start

Overmind orchestrates:
├── Infrastructure Services (auto-checked)
│   ├── PostgreSQL ✓
│   ├── Redis ✓
│   ├── Neo4j ✓
│   └── NATS ✓
├── Application Services (auto-started)
│   ├── Temporal (workflow engine)
│   ├── Caddy (API gateway with TLS)
│   ├── Go backend (Air hot reload)
│   ├── Python backend (uvicorn hot reload)
│   └── Frontend (Vite HMR)
└── Unified management via tmux
    Automatic routing, health checks, centralized logs
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ One-command startup/shutdown
- ✅ Automatic service health checks
- ✅ Intelligent API routing via Caddy
- ✅ Unified logging and monitoring
- ✅ Hot reload for all services
- ✅ Zero-downtime configuration updates
- ✅ Graceful service dependency management

---

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Unified Process Management (Overmind + tmux)

**Implementation:**
- Single `Procfile` defines all services
- Overmind manages process lifecycle
- tmux provides persistent sessions
- Graceful shutdown handling

**Benefits:**
- Services start in correct dependency order
- Failed services restart automatically
- Real-time log streaming
- Interactive service connection

### 2. Intelligent API Gateway (Caddy)

**Implementation:**
- Zero-config TLS/SSL in development
- Path-based routing (Go vs Python APIs)
- WebSocket proxy with authentication
- Access logging and metrics

**Routing Strategy:**
```
http://localhost/
├── /                          → Frontend (Vite dev server)
├── /api/v1/projects/*         → Go backend
├── /api/v1/items/*            → Go backend
├── /api/v1/specifications/*   → Python backend
├── /api/v1/executions/*       → Python backend
├── /api/v1/mcp/*              → Python backend
└── /api/v1/ws                 → WebSocket (Go)
```

**Benefits:**
- No CORS configuration needed
- Consistent URL structure
- Production-like development
- Easy migration to production

### 3. Multi-Language Hot Reload

**Frontend (Vite HMR):**
- React component updates: <100ms
- CSS changes: instant
- State preservation across reloads
- Zero configuration required

**Python (Uvicorn):**
- File change detection: <200ms
- Service restart: 1-3 seconds
- Zero downtime for API consumers
- Automatic dependency reload

**Go (Air):**
- Change detection: <500ms
- Rebuild + restart: 2-5 seconds
- Incremental compilation
- Error recovery with rollback

### 4. Developer CLI (`rtm dev`)

**Commands Implemented:**
```bash
rtm dev install      # One-time tool installation
rtm dev check        # Infrastructure health check
rtm dev start        # Start all services
rtm dev stop         # Graceful shutdown
rtm dev restart      # Restart specific/all services
rtm dev status       # Service status overview
rtm dev logs         # Unified log viewing
rtm dev connect      # Attach to service terminal
```

**Integration:**
- Python Click framework
- Platform-specific tool detection
- Automatic service discovery
- Colorized output for clarity
