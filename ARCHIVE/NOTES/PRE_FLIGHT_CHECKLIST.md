# Pre-Flight Checklist - Ready for Agent Execution
**Project:** TraceRTM Code Coverage Enhancement to 85%+
**Execution Start Date:** [Set by team]
**Target Completion:** 8 weeks + 2 week buffer = 10 weeks total

## Quick Note for Agents

**New:** See `PRE_STARTUP_VALIDATION.md` for environment validation checklist (required before starting Phase 1). This pre-flight is for leads; agents should use the validation checklist instead.

## Risk Management

### If Behind Schedule (Early Warning Signs)
**Warning Signs:**
- Coverage not increasing >5% per week
- Tests taking >2x expected time
- Agent blocked >24 hours
- More than 1 critical blocker at once

**Response:**
- [ ] Escalate to lead immediately
- [ ] Review what's slowing progress
- [ ] Adjust priorities (focus on P0 only)
- [ ] Offer additional resources
- [ ] Extend timeline if needed

### If Tests Are Slow (<5% of week actual vs expected)
**Warning Signs:**
- Individual tests taking >5 seconds
- Full WP test suite taking >5 minutes
- Parallel execution slowing things down

**Response:**
- [ ] Profile slow tests: `pytest --durations=10`
- [ ] Check database queries: Are they optimized?
- [ ] Use SQLite in-memory (faster)
- [ ] Consider splitting integration tests

### If Coverage Plateaus (No increase 3+ days)
**Warning Signs:**
- Lots of tests added but coverage not changing
- Tests passing but lines still uncovered

**Response:**
- [ ] Run: `pytest --cov=... --cov-report=term-with-missing`
- [ ] Find uncovered lines (marked with "0")
- [ ] Add specific tests for those lines
- [ ] Review if tests actually exercise code (no mocks)
- [ ] Check if code paths unreachable (dead code?)

### If Tests Fail Unexpectedly
**Warning Signs:**
- Tests pass locally but fail in CI
- Tests interfere with each other
- Database state carries between tests

**Response:**
- [ ] Add `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` for cleanup
- [ ] Use fresh database per test: `self.db = get_test_db()`
- [ ] Run tests serially to isolate: `pytest -p no:xdist`
- [ ] Check for global state modifications
- [ ] Review test order: `pytest --collect-only`

   - Create empty test file from TEMPLATE.py

4. **Run first test** (15 min)
   - Follow AGENT_QUICK_START.md pattern
   - Write 1 simple test
   - Run it: `pytest tests/integration/test_YOUR_SERVICE.py::TestClass::test_one -v`
   - See it pass

5. **Daily standup** (15 min)
   - Quick sync to confirm everyone ready
   - Report: Setup complete, ready to start

## Go-Live Verification

Run this before agents start Phase 1 work:

```bash
# Verify pytest works
pytest --version
# Expected: pytest 9.x.x

# Verify coverage works
coverage --version
# Expected: coverage 7.x.x

# Run existing tests (sanity check)
pytest tests/unit/ -x -v
# Expected: Tests passing

# Verify database
python3 -c "from src.tracertm.core.database import get_db; db = get_db(); print('✅ Database working')"

# Verify imports
python3 -c "from src.tracertm.services.query_service import QueryService; print('✅ Services importable')"

# Verify git
git status
git log --oneline -1
# Expected: On main branch, can see commits

# Verify branch creation
git checkout -b test-branch
git checkout main
git branch -D test-branch
# Expected: All successful
```
