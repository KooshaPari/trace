## The Challenge

**Current State:**
- **Coverage:** 12.10% (2,092 lines covered)
- **Tests:** 8,244 tests collected
- **Problem:** Tests are heavily mocked, not exercising real code
- **Gap:** 30,908 lines untested

**Target:**
- **Coverage:** 85-100%
- **Tests:** 12,000-15,000 real integration tests
- **Approach:** Convert mocked tests to real integration tests

## Daily/Weekly Execution

### Each Agent's Daily Routine
```
Morning (30 min):
  - Update from main branch
  - Read standup notes from yesterday
  - Plan tests to write

During Day (6 hours):
  - Write tests
  - Run tests locally
  - Check coverage with: pytest --cov=... --cov-report=term-with-missing

Before Standup (15 min):
  - Commit progress
  - Prepare standup report:
    * Tests added: [count]
    * Coverage: [%]
    * Blockers: [if any]
```

### Daily Standup (15 min)
```
Each agent: "I completed [X] tests, coverage now [Y]%, next is [Z]"
Lead: "Any blockers? Any help needed?"
```

### Weekly Review (1 hour)
```
Monday:
  - Run full coverage report
  - Review progress vs. targets
  - Adjust plan if needed
  - Identify blockers early

End of Week:
  - Compile weekly summary
  - Update dashboard
  - Plan next week
  - Review any failures
```

## Key Documents Reference

### Must Read
1. **AGENT_QUICK_START.md** - Get you productive in 1 hour
2. **WORK_PACKAGES_AGENTS.md** - Your specific work packages (32 total)

### Reference
3. **WORK_TICKET_TEMPLATE.md** - Detailed ticket structure
4. **CODE_COVERAGE_EVALUATION_85-100.md** - Why 12.1% is low
5. **TEST_COVERAGE_AUDIT_2025.md** - Audit findings
6. **COVERAGE_PROGRESS_DASHBOARD.md** - Track progress

### Examples
7. **tests/integration/TEMPLATE.py** - Test structure template
8. **tests/integration/conftest.py** - Fixtures & setup

---

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Do ✅
1. **Write real integration tests** (not mocked)
2. **Use real database** (SQLite in-memory)
3. **Run tests locally first** before pushing
4. **Update dashboard daily** with coverage %
5. **Keep tests independent** (no inter-test dependencies)
6. **Document test intent** in docstrings

### Must Not Do ❌
1. **Mock the service layer** (defeats purpose)
2. **Skip error cases** (edge cases matter)
3. **Leave hanging tests** (use timeouts)
4. **Create brittle tests** (use real data)
5. **Ignore test failures** (debug immediately)
6. **Work in isolation** (communicate daily)

---

## Risk Management

### If Behind Schedule
- Focus on P0 work packages first
- Skip P2 if needed (lower priority)
- Extend week 7-8 if needed
- Parallelize more aggressively

### If Coverage Plateaus
- Identify uncovered lines using coverage report
- Add targeted tests for specific lines
- Check for dead code that can be removed
- Review mocking patterns

### If Tests Are Slow
- Use SQLite in-memory (faster)
- Run in parallel: `pytest -n auto`
- Split into unit/integration runs
- Optimize database queries in tests

### If Infrastructure Issues
- Reach out to lead immediately
- Document the issue
- Work on different work package while waiting
- Share learnings with team
